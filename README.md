**7. Code Generation:**
- **Overview:** Explain the process of traversing the AST to generate assembly code.
- **Mapping Constructs:** Provide examples of how high-level constructs are mapped to CPU instructions.
- **Code:** Include code for the code generation phase.

**8. Integration and Testing:**
- **Integration:** Describe how the lexer, parser, and code generator are integrated into a single compiler program.
- **Testing:** Provide details on testing the compiler with SimpleLang programs and verifying the generated assembly code.

**9. Conclusion:**
- **Summary:** Summarize the project, the learning outcomes, and the experience gained in compiler construction and CPU architecture.

### Tools for Documentation and Presentation

- **Documentation:**
  - **Markdown:** Use Markdown for writing documentation (e.g., GitHub README.md).
  - **Doxygen:** Generate documentation from annotated source code.
  - **Word/Google Docs:** For a more formal document format.

- **Presentation:**
  - **PowerPoint/Google Slides:** Create slides with text, images, and demos.
  - **Live Demos:** Prepare scripts and examples to demonstrate the compiler's functionality live.
  - **Screen Recording:** Record demos in advance as backup during the presentation.

By following this structured approach, you can effectively document the design and implementation of your compiler and create a compelling presentation to showcase your work.
